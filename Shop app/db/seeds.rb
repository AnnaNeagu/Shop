# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# Product.find_or_create_by(bar_code: "shyd5tf8").update_attributes(name: "Grape",price: 12.0, image: "grape.jpg", description: "These grapes were grown in Greece. They come from the Natural Products farm. They have a superior quality being grown with natural rooting")
